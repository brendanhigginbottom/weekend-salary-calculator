This application uses a form to gather user input of employee information* and stores it in a global array of objects. Each time a user adds an employee, a table is generated by clearing the existing table, appending each employee/object, and calculates the total monthly cost of each employee's annual salary.

An employee can be removed from the array via the "Delete" button at the end of their respective table row.
The functionality works such that when the row is removed, the employee is spliced from the global array of objects determined by employee ID**, and then the function to append the array of employees/objects is called again. By removing an employee, their annual salary is not summed and the monthly cost is updated automatically. If the total monthly cost exceeds 20000, the background-color is made red.

* Employee ID and annual salary fields expect no punctuation (ie, 50000 and not 50,000.00).
* Note: This functionality assumes that no two employees will have the same employee ID. If this is the case, the application will require some updates.
